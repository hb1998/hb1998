### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on  **React,Angular,Ionic,Node,Express,MongoDB**
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning  **GoLang,GraphQL**
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on **Everything JS**
- âš¡ Fun fact: 
 Idk why so many javascript devs are naming their libraries after something related to science.
   - For starters.
      - Ionic
      - Meteor
      - Polymer
      - Angular, somewhat related to physics.
      - Electron
